# Potato-Disease-Classification

Potato Disease Classification is a cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision project focused on safeguarding potato crops from various diseases. This innovative system employs advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify diseases that affect potato plants. By analyzing images of potato plants, leaves, or tubers, this technology can swiftly and reliably distinguish between healthy plants and those afflicted by diseases such as late blight, early blight, potato virus Y, or blackleg.

The primary goal of Potato Disease Classification is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in making timely and informed decisions regarding disease management. By providing rapid and precise disease diagnosis, this system enables early intervention, optimizing crop yields, reducing the use of pesticides, and ultimately enhancing food security.

Key components of Potato Disease Classification include a vast database of annotated images representing various disease symptoms, a robust neural network model for image analysis, and a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload images for real-time disease detection. This technology is poised to revolutionize potato farming by minimizing crop losses, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and ensuring the availability of this crucial food source for communities worldwide
